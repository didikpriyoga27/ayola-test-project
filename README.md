# Ayola Test Project - React Native

## Application Overview

This React Native project is intended to demonstrate a basic flow for user registration, verification through OTP (One-Time Password), and login functionality.

### Features

- **Registration**: User registration details are stored locally in the React Native SQLite storage.
- **OTP Verification**: During registration, the OTP validation is hardcoded to accept "111111" as a valid input.
- **Login**: The login functionality validates users based on their existence in the system.
